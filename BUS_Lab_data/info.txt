BUS lab developed system Experimental data. 
There is a single file containing beamformed data.
You have to compute resolution from the data at different depths.

Experimental acquisition parameters are as follows
1. Focus is at 20 mm depth
2. Sampling frequency=32 MHz
3. Transmit frequency= 2.44 MHz

Assume Speed of sound = 1540 m/s
