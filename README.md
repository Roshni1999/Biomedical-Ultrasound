# Biomedical-Ultrasound

Experiments conducted as part of Advanced BME Lab (AM5019) during December 2021 & January 2022.

## EXPERIMENT 1: Estimate the resolution and contrast of an Ultrasound System
OBJECTIVES: <br/>
i. Estimate the axial and lateral resolution from images obtained from three different ultrasound systems operating at different frequencies for the tissue mimicking phantom. <br/>
ii. Understand the dependency of frequency on resolution. <br/>
iii. Compute the contrast ratio and contrast to noise ratio for the images obtained from different ultrasound systems.<br/>

## EXPERIMENT 2: Axial and lateral resolution estimation in ultrasound simulation.
OBJECTIVES: <br/>
Estimate the practical axial and lateral resolution values from a simulation of an ultrasound transducer. <br/>

## EXPERIMENT 3: Speed of sound measurement in a tissue phantom using an ultrasound probe.
OBJECTIVES: <br/>
i. Find the speed of sound (m/s) in a tissue mimicking phantom using an ultrasound probe. <br/>
ii. Calculate the Acoustic Impedance (kg/m2s). <br/>
iii. Calculate the Amplitude Attenuation Coefficient (dB/cm-1MHz-1). <br/>
