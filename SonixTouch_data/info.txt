SonixTouch Experimental data 
There are two files containing beamformed data
You have to compute resolution from the resolution data and contrast from the contrast data.

Experimental acquisition parameters are as follows
1. Focus is at 20 mm depth
2. 64 elements were excited during the transmit and 128 elements were used for data acquisition during the receive.
3. Sampling frequency=40 MHz
4. Transmit frequency= 13.3 MHz

Assume Speed of sound = 1540 m/s
